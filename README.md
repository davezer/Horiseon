# Horiseon starter code

Supplied code by developer to refractor. 
The index.html file code was edited to be more semantic and remove redundant code.
The style.css file code was also edited to remove redundant code but also consolidated
    while remaining functional.
Notes were added along the way to indicate where each style should begin and end.

## Usage

All code was updated to ensure all links are working as intended. Now clicking each header link will take you to the correct section of the website.
